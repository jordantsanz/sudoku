To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

To test, run `make valgrind`.

Master contains a copy of the basic submission per the rubric. The same can be found in baseProjectSubmit. Some code had to be changed to support the UI, so you can find our UI/Extra Credit in the branch titled ExtraCredit. We beautified the project here in master after we split off and started to work on the UI, so for base documentation and testing, please run it in this branch (ie master). You can view ExtraCredit as primarily being the UI (ie graphics.py) with the branch also containing needed support code.

To run executable in the top level directory (the one this read me is in), run `./sudoku`.

Furthur documentation and README.md's are in subdirectories and DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, and TESTING.md in this directory
